Its metaphysics posits a single, transcendent God who is a Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). The cosmology is one of creation *ex nihilo* (out of nothing) by God. Christian anthropology views humans as created in the image of God (`Imago Dei`), possessing an immortal soul but tainted by original sin. Soteriology is achieved through grace by faith in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, which atones for sin and promises eternal life. Christian ethics are largely based on divine command as revealed in the Bible, particularly the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus. Praxis is varied but typically includes prayer, sacraments (like Baptism and Eucharist), and communal worship. Epistemology is rooted in faith and divine revelation (the Bible), though reason and tradition are also important sources of truth for many denominations.\n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 5 |\n| Cosmology | 5 |\n| Anthropology | 4 |\n| Soteriology | 5 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 5 |\n| Praxis | 4 |\n| Epistemology | 4 |\n\n***\n\n### Buddhism ‚ò∏Ô∏è\nBuddhism is a non-theistic religion or philosophy originating with Siddhartha Gautama. Its metaphysics avoids a creator God, instead viewing reality as an interdependent, impermanent flow characterized by suffering (`Dukkha`). The cosmology is cyclical (`Samsara`), without a beginning or end, governed by natural law. Buddhist anthropology rejects the notion of a permanent soul (`Anatta`), viewing the person as a temporary combination of five aggregates (`Skandhas`). Soteriology is the attainment of Nirvana‚Äîliberation from `Samsara`‚Äîachieved through personal effort via the Noble Eightfold Path. Ethics are based on principles of non-harm (`Ahimsa`), compassion, and the law of `Karma`. Praxis is centered on meditation, mindfulness, and adherence to ethical precepts. Epistemology is primarily experiential and empirical, emphasizing personal insight and verification of teachings rather than blind faith. \n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 3 |\n| Cosmology | 2 |\n| Anthropology | 2 |\n| Soteriology | 2 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 3 |\n| Praxis | 4 |\n| Epistemology | 2 |\n\n***\n\n### Hinduism üïâÔ∏è\nHinduism is a diverse family of traditions with a complex metaphysics that can be monotheistic, polytheistic, or pantheistic, but generally recognizes an ultimate, single reality known as `Brahman`. Its cosmology is cyclical, with universes being created, destroyed, and recreated in an endless series. The anthropology is grounded in the concept of the `Atman`, an eternal, unchanging soul that is ultimately identical with `Brahman`. The soteriology, or `Moksha`, is liberation from the cycle of reincarnation (`Samsara`), achievable through various paths (`yogas`) like devotion, action, and knowledge. Ethics are based on `Dharma` (duty, righteousness) and `Karma` (the law of cause and effect). Praxis is exceptionally diverse, including temple worship (`puja`), meditation, pilgrimage, and home rituals. Epistemology accepts scripture (`Vedas`), reason, and direct experience as valid sources of knowledge.\n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 5 |\n| Cosmology | 4 |\n| Anthropology | 5 |\n| Soteriology | 3 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 4 |\n| Praxis | 5 |\n| Epistemology | 4 |\n\n***\n\n### Atheism ‚öõÔ∏è\nAtheism, in the modern sense, is not a religion but a stance on belief, specifically the lack of belief in any gods. As such, its dimensions are defined by what it rejects. The metaphysics is typically **physicalism** or **materialism**, holding that only matter and energy are fundamentally real. Cosmology is understood through naturalistic models like the Big Bang and cosmic evolution. Anthropology views humans as highly evolved biological organisms, without an immortal soul or divine purpose. Its \"soteriology\" is secular, focusing on achieving well-being and meaning in this life through human effort and reason. Ethics are derived from humanistic principles‚Äîsuch as empathy, reason, and consequentialism‚Äîrather than divine commands. Praxis is non-existent in a religious sense, and epistemology is staunchly **empiricist** and **rationalist**, relying on scientific inquiry and logical proof.\n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 1 |\n| Cosmology | 1 |\n| Anthropology | 1 |\n| Soteriology | 1 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 2 |\n| Praxis | 1 |\n| Epistemology | 1 |\n\n***\n\n### Islam ‚ò™Ô∏è\nIslam is a strictly monotheistic religion based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad. Its metaphysics centers on the absolute oneness and transcendence of God (`Allah`). Islamic cosmology affirms that Allah created the universe and all that is in it. The anthropology sees humans as created by Allah, possessing a soul, and having the role of a vicegerent or servant (`Abd Allah`) on Earth. Soteriology is based on submission (`Islam`) to the will of Allah, with a final Day of Judgment determining one's eternal fate in paradise or hell. Ethics and law (`Sharia`) are derived directly from divine revelation in the **Qur'an** and the example of the Prophet (`Sunnah`). Praxis is defined by the obligatory **Five Pillars**: the declaration of faith, prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and pilgrimage to Mecca. Epistemology is heavily centered on the Qur'an as the final and infallible revelation from God. \n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 5 |\n| Cosmology | 5 |\n| Anthropology | 4 |\n| Soteriology | 4 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 5 |\n| Praxis | 5 |\n| Epistemology | 5 |\n\n***\n\n### Judaism ‚ú°Ô∏è\nJudaism is a monotheistic religion founded on a covenantal relationship between God and the Jewish people. Its metaphysics asserts a single, transcendent God who is active in history. The cosmology is of a universe created by God as described in Genesis. Jewish anthropology views humans as created in God's image, with a responsibility to uphold their side of the divine covenant. Soteriology is less focused on individual afterlife salvation and more on fulfilling the covenant, living a righteous life, and contributing to the mending of the world (`Tikkun Olam`). Ethics are based on divine law as revealed in the **Torah**, comprising 613 commandments (`mitzvot`). Praxis includes the observance of these laws, including the Sabbath, dietary laws (`kashrut`), prayer, and life-cycle events. Epistemology is based on revelation (the Torah) and an extensive tradition of rabbinic interpretation (the Talmud).\n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 5 |\n| Cosmology | 5 |\n| Anthropology | 4 |\n| Soteriology | 3 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 5 |\n| Praxis | 4 |\n| Epistemology | 4 |\n\n***\n\n### Shintoism ‚õ©Ô∏è\nShinto is the indigenous faith of Japan, an animistic religion that holds that `kami` (gods or spirits) inhabit all things. Its metaphysics is polytheistic and immanent, with the natural world being infused with divinity. The cosmology is mythological, detailing the creation of the Japanese islands by the `kami`. Shinto anthropology views humans as fundamentally good and as descendants of the `kami`, with the emperor traditionally seen as a direct descendant of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. There is no formal soteriology; the focus is on maintaining purity, harmony, and sincerity (`makoto`) in this life to appease the `kami`. Ethics are situational, based on a continuum of purity and pollution rather than absolute good and evil. Praxis is centered on worship at shrines, purification rituals, and seasonal festivals (`matsuri`). Epistemology is rooted in myth, tradition, and ritual practice.\n\n| Dimension | Score (1-5) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Metaphysics | 3 |\n| Cosmology | 3 |\n| Anthropology | 3 |\n| Soteriology | 1 |\n| Ethics & Morality | 2 |\n| Praxis | 4 |\n| Epistemology | 3 |\n\n***\n\n## Inter-religious Distance Matrix\n\nThis table calculates the \"distance\" between each pair of worldviews using the Euclidean distance formula on their 7-dimensional score vectors: $D = \\sqrt{\\sum (score_{A} - score_{B})^2}$. A **lower number** indicates greater similarity based on the assigned scores.\n\n| | Christianity | Buddhism | Hinduism | Atheism | Islam | Judaism | Shintoism |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Christianity** | 0.00 | 6.40 | 2.65 | 9.17 | **1.73** | **2.00** | 5.39 |\n| **Buddhism** | 6.40 | 0.00 | 5.10 | 4.00 | 6.86 | 6.16 | **2.45** |\n| **Hinduism** | 2.65 | 5.10 | 0.00 | 8.83 | 3.16 | 2.45 | 5.10 |\n| **Atheism** | 9.17 | 4.00 | 8.83 | 0.00 | 9.64 | 9.00 | 4.12 |\n| **Islam** | **1.73** | 6.86 | 3.16 | 9.64 | 0.00 | **2.45** | 6.16 |\n| **Judaism** | **2.00** | 6.16 | 2.45 | 9.00 | **2.45** | 0.00 | 5.00 |\n| **Shintoism** | 5.39 | **2.45** | 5.10 | 4.12 | 6.16 | 5.00 | 0.00 |\n\nAs shown, the Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) cluster closely together. Atheism is distant from all theistic religions, while the Eastern traditions of Buddhism and Shintoism show proximity to each other. Hinduism occupies a position close to the Abrahamic faiths (sharing high scores in metaphysics and anthropology) but also reasonably close to Buddhism."
